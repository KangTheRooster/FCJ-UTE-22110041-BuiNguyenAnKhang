### Introduction

In the context of the rapid development of digital technology, music has become an indispensable part of people's daily lives. Creating an online music streaming application not only meets entertainment needs but also connects users to a diverse and rich world of music. With the popularity of platforms like **Spotify**, developing a similar application and integrating modern, user‑friendly features is an effective solution to enhance the music listening experience and attract users.

This project focuses on building an online music streaming application based on **Java Spring Boot**, inspired by Spotify. The system is designed with key features such as:
- Online music playback  
- Creating and managing playlists  
- Searching and recommending songs based on user preferences  
- Managing user accounts  
- Supporting offline music downloads for convenience and flexibility  

The development process applied core principles of **Software Engineering**, including:
- Requirements analysis (SRS)  
- System design with **Use Case diagrams**, **Class diagrams**, **Sequence diagrams**, and **Collaboration diagrams**  
- Building an object‑oriented system architecture  
- Integrating APIs to deliver a smooth and high‑quality music streaming experience  

Through the implementation of the project, the team had the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to practice, covering requirements analysis, system design, deployment, and testing. This process not only deepened the team’s understanding of the **software development lifecycle** but also honed **programming, problem‑solving, and teamwork skills**.

However, due to time constraints and limited experience, the development process inevitably faced some challenges — from **suboptimal interface design** to **system performance limitations**. These shortcomings serve as valuable lessons, and the team welcomes contributions and feedback to further refine the lab in the future.

To ensure **scalability, security, and reliability**, the system is **hosted on AWS**. It uses **Elastic Beanstalk** to deploy the backend, **RDS (Aurora MySQL)** for database management, **S3** for media storage, and **Amplify (Cognito)** for authentication and frontend integration. This cloud‑based architecture ensures the application can grow with user demand while maintaining high performance and availability.
